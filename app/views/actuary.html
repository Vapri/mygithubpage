			<h3>Why I want to be an Actuary?</h3>
			<p>
				During my young adult years, I have always been intrigued with what one may achieve through mathematics. The knowledge I have gathered throughout my institutional studies and personal studies have allowed me to develop skills that equipped me with the ability to solve various mathematical problems. Thus seeing as the actuarial world consisted of applying such skills in order to encourage healthier behaviors and risk management, which both are of interest to me, I decided to pursue this profession.
